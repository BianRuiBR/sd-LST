# sd-LST
Small Data Least-Squares Transformation (sd-LST) for Fast Calibration of SSVEP-based BCIs

The matlab codes for sdLST and some baselines.

matlab version: R2020a

You can run demo.m to test sdLST and stCCA, but data inlcude only one source subject and one target subject, so the results are not representative.
